#+TITLE: README

This is where I keep my dot-files.

** Installation

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] is the only requirement for running [[./install.sh][install.sh]]:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/solkaz/dot-files
cd dot-files
sh install.sh
#+end_src

=install.sh= will create symlinks in the home directory to the folders
in the project, which will be picked up by the programs in
question. This allows me to have a centralized location that I can
make changes to my configurations (and track with Git). After running
the install script for the first time, I don't need to run it again
unless I change the file structure within this project itself.

** What's configured?

- Emacs
- Git
- Tmux
- Vim
- Zsh

** License

[[./LICENSE][MIT]]
